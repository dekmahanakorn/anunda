  * We can begin auditing the l10n groups
  * Need to flesh out a md file to pass i18n groups for auditing
* [#34: i18n WG Meeting Time & Frequency](https://github.com/nodejs/i18n/issues/34)
  * Ben to propose times in the issue and seek consensus/objections
* [#48: Problems found in Electron/i18n from a standpoint of one translator/proofreader](https://github.com/nodejs/i18n/issues/48)
  * Untranslatable words: still had to put complete mds on Crowdin and ? (missed that)
  * Need to have granular promotion for proofreaders (promotion on a language basis)
  * Make use of the glossary feature on Crowdin to improve translation of specific terms
* [#50: Key based i18n vs default language i18n](https://github.com/nodejs/i18n/issues/50)
  * Not everything probably should be translated from a default language
  * Need to define process to isolate strings to be key-based translated/localized
  * Zeke explains they had to add tests to ensure every string associated with a key was used in at least one template, and that every key had at least one translation
  * Need more definition/discussion on the actual problem/context
* [#59: Require status checks and reviews before PRs can be merged](https://github.com/nodejs/i18n/issues/59)


* [#58: continuous integration](https://github.com/nodejs/i18n/issues/58)
  * Tierney: Need to make sure we have link checking to avoid 404

  * Andriy: would potentially have several possible solutions to this problem and could present them at the next meeting
