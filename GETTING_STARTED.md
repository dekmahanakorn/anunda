#  Getting started

**Thank you for volunteering to translate Node.js content to your language!**

By translating Node.js content (website, api, tutorials), you are directly impacting developers around the world. Your efforts will help developers in more countries to learn Node.js! Thank you so much for volunteering your time!

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to report@nodejs.org.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Node.js localization effort.

## Translating

Here are some guidelines to keep in mind as a translator:

- Don't open pull requests to translate Node.js; instead, do all translations on  [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/nodejs).
- Do not translate JavaScript keywords like `String`, `Event`, `Array`, `Class`, etc.
- Do not translate Node.js module names, method names, event names, etc.
- If you find an error in the source English docs, open a pull request on the [nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/doc) repository.
- If you've been working as a translator and want to have more influence over the approved translations in your language, let know managers on the Crowdin platform and they will make you a proofreader.

Node.js localization effort uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), an awesome platform for 
collaborative translation. The work in Crowdin generate automated PRs & updates to [Node.js i18n](https://github.com/nodejs/i18n) repo.

To get started, visit **[crowdin.com/project/nodejs](https://crowdin.com/project/nodejs)** and log in with your GitHub account.

## How translations are selected

Members of the project are either a translator or proofreader. A translator can provide translations, while a proofreader can both provide translations as well as select the best translation to be used on the site.

The final translation that appears in Node.js content is selected as follows:

1. A proofreader selects the best translation.
2. If there is no translation selected by a proofreader, translators vote on the best translation and the translation with the most votes is selected.
3. If votes are tied, the most recent translation will be selected.

## Proofreading

If you would like to be promoted to proofreader status on the Node.js project, please translate 1,000 words or more before applying. When contacting managers on Crowdin, please include a link to your existing translations on the project.

## The role of the l10n group

The l10n group for specific languages aims to gather people interested in taking part in the translation process in one place, so 
that it can be used as a source of help when problems/doubts arise during the translation process.
To contact a specific l10n group, all you need is an account on Github. You do not have to be a member of this group to start the 
translation process.

If you are unable to find help on the l10n group for your specific language, you can always ask for help on the 
[Node.js i18n](https://github.com/nodejs/i18n) repo.

## Introduction to the Crowdin platform

Node.js localization effort uses [Crowdin]((https://crowdin.com/project/nodejs)), an awesome platform for collaborative translation. 
It's free for open source projects, and anyone who understands multiples languages is welcome to join in the effort, regardless of 
their technical experience or familiarity with the Node.js project.

**The Crowdin advantage:**

- Asking translators to jump into the Github environment is confusing enough. Crowdin beautifully abstracts away the cruft into a simple & useful interface.

- Each localization project contains a directory tree of the core project’s documents–giving the translator continuous visibility on what has and hasn’t been translated, streamlining the process entirely.

- A simple work environment presents untranslated documents in one row, and the localized version being updated in another.

- A Crowdin project seamlessly integrates with an existing Github repo, automating PRs & updates from its internationalization projects.
